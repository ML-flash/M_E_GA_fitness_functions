# Note: For discrete genes, the `genes` attribute should be a list of strings. The decode method 
# will return the decoded organism as a list of genes to be evaluated by the fitness function.
# Organisms in genetic algorithms may have variable lengths. If the implementation requires a target length, 
# it should account for it by applying a penalty in the fitness function to encourage the formation 
# of organisms that match the target length. See the `LeadingOnesFitness` example for usage description.
