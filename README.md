### M_E_GA_fitness_functions

Welcome to the MEGA repository where you can contribute to the evolution of our genetic algorithm by submitting custom fitness functions using discrete genes. These submissions are crucial for testing and challenging our framework to ensure robustness and versatility. Please note that contributions are intended for experimental purposes only and will not be included in any formal release.

#### How to Contribute
1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the repository to your own account.
2. **Set Up Your Environment:** Ensure Python is installed on your system. Our code relies solely on the Python standard library, so no additional dependencies are needed.
3. **Explore the Provided Classes:**
   - `LeadingOnesFitness`: Calculates fitness based on the number of consecutive '1's at the start of an organism and applies a penalty based on organism length.
   - `MockGA`: Simulates a genetic algorithm, including methods for decoding organisms.
   - `generate_random_organism`: Creates a random organism with a specified length and gene set.
   - `update_best_organism`: Updates the record of the best organism based on its fitness score.
4. **Customize Your Fitness Function:**
   - Develop a new class modeled after `LeadingOnesFitness` that implements your fitness evaluation logic.
   - Make sure your class includes a `compute` method for fitness assessment.
5. **Integrate and Test:**
   - Replace the `LeadingOnesFitness` class with your implementation.
   - Update the instantiation in the main code to use your new class.
6. **Run and Evaluate:**
   - Follow the steps to initialize the fitness function, generate a random organism, and compute its fitness.
   - Analyze the output to assess the performance of your fitness function within the genetic algorithm.

### Example Implementation

```python
# Hereâ€™s an example of how to replace the LeadingOnesFitness class with your implementation:
class YourFitnessClass:
    def __init__(self, max_length, update_best_func):
        self.max_length = max_length
        self.update_best = update_best_func

    def compute(self, encoded_individual, ga_instance):
        decoded_individual = ga_instance.decode_organism(encoded_individual)
        fitness_score = self.calculate_fitness(decoded_individual)
        final_fitness = self.apply_penalty(decoded_individual, fitness_score)
        self.update_means(encoded_individual, final_fitness)
        return final_fitness

# Main execution block:
# Replace LeadingOnesFitness with YourFitnessClass in the configuration
fitness_function = YourFitnessClass(MAX_LENGTH, update_best_organism)
random_organism = generate_random_organism(genes, 50)  # Example organism length
mock_ga = MockGA()
fitness_score = fitness_function.compute(random_organism, mock_ga)
print(f"Organism: {random_organism}, Fitness: {fitness_score}")
```

By participating, you help us refine the robustness and capabilities of MEGA through innovative experimental designs. We look forward to seeing how your custom fitness functions can challenge our framework. Thank you for contributing to this experimental venture!
