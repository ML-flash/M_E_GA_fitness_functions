# M_E_GA_fitness_functions
Contribute to MEGA's growth by submitting custom fitness functions using discrete genes. Start with our example class. Fork, add your function and test it with the fitness function tester. Instructions below. 

To test the provided code with a custom fitness function, follow these instructions:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the code to your local machine.

2. **Set up Dependencies**: Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. The code does not have any external dependencies beyond the Python standard library.

3. **Understand the Code**:
   - `LeadingOnesFitness` class: Represents the fitness function for the leading ones problem. It counts the number of leading '1's in an organism and penalizes its length.
   - `MockGA` class: Mocks the genetic algorithm instance and provides a method for decoding organisms.
   - `generate_random_organism` function: Generates a random organism with a specified length and gene set.
   - `update_best_organism` function: Updates the global record of the best organism based on fitness.

4. **Configure Parameters**:
   - Adjust the `MAX_LENGTH` parameter to define the maximum length of the organisms.
   - Modify the `genes` list to specify the gene set for the organisms.

5. **Define a Custom Fitness Function**:
   - Create a new fitness function class similar to `LeadingOnesFitness` that implements your custom fitness calculation logic. Ensure it has a `compute` method to evaluate the fitness of an organism.

6. **Update the Configuration**:
   - Initialize your custom fitness function instead of `LeadingOnesFitness`.
   - Adjust any additional parameters or configurations specific to your custom fitness function.

7. **Run the Simulation**:
   - Follow the same steps as before to initialize the fitness function, generate a random organism, and compute its fitness score.

8. **Analyze Results**: Review the printed output to understand the performance of the genetic algorithm with your custom fitness function.

By following these steps, you can effectively test the provided code with your custom fitness function. This approach allows for flexible experimentation and evaluation of different fitness functions within the genetic algorithm framework.
